                    "In Super City Rampage, 8-Bit's damage booster can be used as a last-resort meatshield to escape from the monster during the anger stages as the monster will attack any turrets and spawnables such as Jessie's turret and Nita's Bear. Unless the monster is distracted, 8-Bit can't escape because of his very slow movement speed.",
                    "8-Bit is very vulnerable to fast Brawlers such as Crow and Leon. At the start of Showdown matches, focus first on defeating these Brawlers at a distance before they get closer and can deal higher damage. 8-Bit has one of the longest ranges in the game to compensate for his slow movement, so keep your distance from enemy Brawlers and out-range them, and if an enemy is chasing you, deal as much damage as you can to them from a distance to force enemy retreat. Additionally, you can also escape by using your Cheat Cartridge Gadget to teleport back to your booster and far away from enemies. However, be cautious of airborne Brawlers like El Primo and Edgar who are also fast and can close the distance with their jumps and easily defeat 8-Bit at close range.",
                    "Other than his very slow movement speed, 8-Bit has all that one would require from a Brawler - high health and a high damage output, long range, a reasonable reload speed, area control, and even some support abilities, so he functions well in most game modes. However, he is most viable in Heist, Gem Grab, Hot Zone, and Siege due to his high damage output and area control capabilities. In Bounty, Showdown, Knockout, Special Events, and speed-based events such as Brawl Ball, his slow movement speed hinders his survivability, but his high health, long range, and high damage output compensates for that, making him still viable in these modes.",
                    "Despite his slow speed, 8-Bit's high DPS and significant bulk make him a formidable area control brawler when paired with his booster. As such, 8-Bit can be an excellent goalkeeper in more open Brawl Ball maps and can assist in chipping away at enemy health in Knockout should one be cautious with aiming him. During the latter, hide behind your turret as much as possible since the snipers commonly used in Knockout are unable to pierce."

                    "8-Bit's Cheat Cartridge Gadget can be used to rush and surprise an enemy by throwing his booster over the wall towards the enemy before teleporting to attack them with increased damage, since he normally can't rush an enemy due to his very slow movement speed. It can also be used to escape enemies by teleporting away if you're low on health or if you're being cornered.",
                    "8-Bit's Extra Credits Gadget combined with his Super would deal enough damage to eliminate almost all Brawlers in-game without losing ammo, but it can be easily avoided. Use it on modes with stationary targets like Heist and Siege, with it dealing devastating damage to these above examples. You may also use it in Special Events to deal extra damage to the Bosses in each event, but note that mobility is very important in Super City Rampage and might justify the usage of Cheat Cartridge.",
                    "8-Bit's slow speed makes him vulnerable to being unable to retreat and heal. As such, the recommended gears to equip are the Health and Speed Gears, allowing for 8-Bit to heal up or reach the locations he needs to be in much faster. Alternatively, in maps with choke points the Reload Gear can be used instead, allowing 8-Bit to constantly mow down opponents.",
                    "8-Bit's most valuable asset is his sheer damage, so oftentimes the Damage Gear is best for him to optimize the amount of damage he can deal, especially considering his decent health pool. As 8-Bit's slow unload speed makes him vulnerable to being rushed down and defeated by Brawlers with quick unload speeds, this Gear would also allow 8-Bit to defeat opponents with as few bullets as possible, or at least make them easier for teammates to take down if he is defeated."

                    "An effective trap you can use, especially in Showdown, is to place your booster so that one side is behind a wall and a bush and the other is out in the open. When an enemy Brawler comes to destroy your booster, you can use your Cheat Cartridge Gadget to rush in and quickly eliminate the enemy, and if the enemy manages to destroy it, the damage dealt would've charged your Super back again, so you can pull off the trap again. If it's a Brawler with moving abilities (Edgar, El Primo, Crow, etc.), use your long range to your advantage and aim your attack onto them if they do escape with their ability. This ensures them on low health or even defeats them.",
                    "It is typically a good idea to place your booster behind a wall (unless attacking where you can tank damage with the booster) because it'll be harder to destroy it. This is even more effective with Boosted Booster as it can provide more area of damage boost when keeping the booster behind a wall makes it hard to stay near it. However, this strategy is countered by throwers, Squeak, and Mico as they can hit the booster regardless of any walls in their way.",
                    "Thanks to the slight spread of his attacks, 8-Bit does not fare well against long-ranged sharpshooters and marksmen as his bullets are less accurate at a distance. As such, prioritise attacking mid to short ranged brawlers first to build up your Super, before deploying it to act as a shield and increase the damage of your bullets against longer-ranged brawlers.",
                    "While 8-Bit is bulky, has good range and deals decent damage, his slow speed and inconsistent accuracy at his range's peak make him unsuitable for leading pushes against opposing teams. As such, try to stay slightly behind and offer additional chip damage while you charge your Super, or sneak up via bushes and finish off weakened brawlers.",
                    "In Hot Zone maps such as Ring of Fire, 8-Bit's damage and the choke points present allow him to function as a sort of pseudo-assassin. As such, you should give your booster to your teammates on the Hot Zone while 8-Bit remains in the bushes to ambush opposing brawlers attempting to make a push.",
                    "8-Bit's slow unload speed makes him vulnerable to assassins or brawlers with quick firing rates like Max and Edgar. As such, try to stay in the open to maintain range superiority and avoid walls from which they can rush you.",
                    "The most important thing to do when playing as 8-Bit is to charge and activate his Super. His Super can control a large area and can easily allow you and allies to deal large amounts of damage to enemies. If your Super is taken down, focus on charging up a second Super and pushing back enemies.",
                    "If you are low on health and someone is chasing you, you can place your booster down to tank some shots so you can escape more easily. Keep in mind, this won't be effective against Penny, Jessie, Surge, Belle, or any other Brawler with mechanics that can deal damage to multiple enemies, as their projectiles won't be fully blocked. Also, note that this should be a last-resort action, as he depends on his booster quite a lot.",
                    "Due to 8-Bit's slow movement speed, dodging projectiles from other sharpshooters like Colt or throwers like Barley is difficult. So dealing damage behind cover or from afar is recommended as the enemies won't be able to hit him as easily. This can be compensated with his Plugged In Star Power or other speed boosts, as 8-Bit can fight the fast and long-ranged Brawlers with ease that he's usually prone to in Showdown. It can also be very useful to control, retreat, and reach a target in most 3v3 modes and special events. Though, Boosted Booster is preferred in Robo Rumble, Boss Fight, and Super City Rampage, where speed is less beneficial.",
                    "Byron can use his healing abilities to further justify 8-Bit's already high health at a range, and 8-Bit's Super can boost Byron's healing, so they have a great synergy together. This can also lead to devastating results in Siege if 8-Bit and Byron can remain concealed up to the corners closest to the enemy IKE. 8-Bit must place his booster down to boost his damage and Byron's healing, and Byron heals 8-Bit while 8-Bit deals damage to the IKE, especially with his Extra Credits Gadget. High-damaging Brawlers like Amber, Spike, and Colt also work well with 8-Bit and help him get the most out of the booster.",
                    "When on low health and hiding in a bush, try not to place your Super when the Plugged In Star Power is equipped as the speed boost effect indicator coming from the Super can give away your location. However, if your plan is to escape rather than hide, you may place your Super to tank shots and speed you up."

She can place her puddles over the Gem mine or a zone and prohibit enemies from achieving the respective event objective. If an enemy attempts to cross the puddle, she can ignite it to deal significant damage to the enemy. In addition, the puddles from her Super and Fire Starters Gadget can connect to create an extremely large puddle to control massive areas. The area control provided from the puddles is amplified with her Wild Flames Star Power. You can either connect the puddles to clear bushes or separate them to allow for select area denial."

She can also use this Gadget effectively in modes like Heist, where there is a stationary target. This allows her to deal massive damage with this Gadget, and combined with her piercing attack, Super, and Gadget Gear, she is a menace in such modes.",

                    "Be careful about positioning Amber's Super because if it's thrown in an undesirable position, you might accidentally ignite the puddle when attacking an enemy near it, so try to place the fluid outside your attacking spot but still in your range so you can ignite the puddle at the right time. This also enables you to control two lanes at once.",
                    "Try to predict the enemy's movement in order to land more shots, because there's a tiny yet noticeable delay between aiming and firing. You'll deal maximum damage by aiming where the enemy is likely to move as aiming at the enemy's current position won't damage the moving enemy since Amber's flames travel slowly.",
                    "Amber is an excellent counter to high-health Brawlers because her continuous attack deals enough damage to eliminate them. She can also use her Super to prevent them from healing and finish them off. However, maintain your distance from these Brawlers because Amber, with her moderate health, can be two-shotted or three-shotted by those Brawlers if they get close enough, and she's helpless at close range due to her inability to deal immediate damage and her lack of stuns, slows, or knockbacks to distance herself from such Brawlers.",
                    "Try not to waste ammo with Amber. If Amber is out of ammo, she needs to wait a while to fully reload despite what seems to be an incredibly fast reload speed. With her Scorchin' Siphon Star Power, you can partially mitigate this issue by using her Super or her Fire Starters Gadget to reload quicker. You can also place her Fire Starters Gadget at your spawn point and reload quicker if you die. If you do this you will enter battle with a full ammo bar.",
                    "If you have the Wild Flames Star Power, when you get your Super and throw it, sometimes it is a better idea to wait and keep the Super on the ground so that you charge up more of your Super. This is a good strategy in passive maps and also good if you aren't going to hit an enemy with it, as you can charge another Super.",

This means that enemies will not be spamming their shots, and the five seconds debuff doesn't really do that much to alter the course of the battle. Positive Feedback, on the other hand, is much easier to acquire as all you need to do is to hit your shots.

It is useful to work out in advance if using the knockback is beneficial in a certain situation, and to either discard the knockback by attacking the air, or conserving ammo and storing the knock back ability. You can deliberately discard your knockback from a charged Home Run bar by swinging Bibi's bat prematurely, if your next move is to only attack enemies which you don't want to knockback.

This combination is very effective in Duo Showdown. The combo is also extremely devastating in Siege; if the team dives into the enemy IKE turret's range to attack it, the boosted healing from Byron will momentarily protect 8-Bit while he uses his high damage and his Extra Credits Gadget to take out a major portion, if not all, of the IKE's health.

If Edgar is the stalling Brawler, he should continuously stall the Boss with his high burst damage and the healing provided from his attack, Pam and Byron, and these should make him able to overcome the Boss's damage.

This means that she can deal 8000 damage, or 10% of the safe's health, with one Super. With her Hypercharge, however, she can deal 5000/5600 damage to the heist safe per hit, and since her Hypercharge is able to hit 4 times, she can deal 20000/22400 damage to the safe with one Super. She can also recharge her Super if she hits defending enemies along with the safe. Combined with her fast Super charge rate and Mass Tax Star Power, she can repeatedly use her Super on the safe while reducing damage taken, allowing her to survive longer. Alternatively, her Push It Star Power is useful as it can push enemies away from the safe while defending, and push defending enemies away when attacking the enemy safe, allowing shorter-ranged Brawlers to engage more easily.",
